# POE_Components
This is a free software which provides an installer for aditional components for the [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/game) (POE) game. 

### Why POE_Components is usefull?
At some point every POE player faces a need for additional programs, 
scripts, loot filters, which will make the POE experience much smoother. Installer downloads the latest versions of officially allowed 
components (programs, scripts, loot filters) and installs them in the Path of Exile game folder.

In case if some component, which doesn't provide autoupdater, releases a new version, execute the POE_Components installer, 
and it will download the latest version for the selected components, no need to download anything by hand.
Filters installed via POE_Components will be placed in appropriate folder automatically, no need to move them by hand.
Additionally, POE_Components creates a custom shortcut, which runs all the scripts and shortcuts placed in the specific folder.
Check "Features" section for more info.

### Note
POE_Components was developed for Microsoft Windows users.
POE_Components will work in any Path of Exile version unless some core changes in POE will take place in a file structure.
